Blockchain and cryptocurrency application written in node.js
This is a project consisting of a blockchain and cryptocurrency built from scratch. It was used to gain an understanding of
the basic core structure that goes into making a blockchain and cryptocurrency.
This application utilizes peer-to-peer servers and functions as an API with GET and POST requests.
In addition anyone on the network can send, recieve, and mine an amount of the cryptocurrency.
Future additions to this project will include a React js frontend to display transactions and wallet amounts.
